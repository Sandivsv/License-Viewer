# Getting Started with Create React App

## This is just a trail app to show how can we see license used like APACHE, MIT, ISC of used dependencies like react, express, mongoose and many more.
## If anyone tries to see their dependencies license file
then they can just copy the file code named as licenseChecker.js and paste it into their own react/node folder, and when they run it automatically, a license file is generated in JSON format. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
